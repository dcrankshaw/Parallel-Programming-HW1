To compile everything, use "make" or "make all". To remove generated binaries,
use "clean". To compile just the coin flipping code, use "make part1" and
for just the DES key code use "make part2".

To run the coin flipping code from the root directory of the tarball, use
"java -cp bin edu.jhu.crankshaw.cs.pp420.hw1.p1.CoinFlipMain NUMCOINS NUMTHREADS"
replacing NUMCOINS and NUMTHREADS with your chosen values.

Similarly, to run the DES key decryption code from the root of the tarball, use
"java -cp bin edu.jhu.crankshaw.cs.pp420.hw1.p2.BruteForceDES KEYSIZE NUMTHREADS"
where KEYSIZE is in number of bits.

I placed my java projects into packages, which is why the qualified names of the
class files are so long. Sorry about the length.
